The Concept Library allows for the easy usage of custom textual inversion models. These models may be loaded into `models/custom/sd-concepts-library` and will appear in the Concepts Library in Streamlit. To use one of these custom models in a prompt, either copy it using the button on the model, or type `<model-name>` in the prompt where you wish to use it.
