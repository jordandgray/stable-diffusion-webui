You can use other *versions* of Stable Diffusion, and *fine-tunes* of Stable Diffusion. 

Any model with the `.ckpt` extension can be placed into the `models/custom` folder and used in the UI. The filename of the model will be used to show the model on the drop-down menu on the UI from which you can select and use your custom model so, make sure it has a good filename so you can recognize it from the drop-down menu.
